## My process

I started my website build process with a mobile-first approach, designing the website for mobile devices first. Once I had the basic layout in place, I used CSS to style it and make it look more visually appealing.

Next, I created a desktop view for my website using CSS Grid to create a more complex layout that would look good on larger screens.

Overall, my website build process focused on creating a responsive website that would look good and function well on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. I used a combination of design and development techniques, including mobile-first design, semantic HTML, and CSS styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
